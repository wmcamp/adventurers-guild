<h2>The Council of Saltmarsh</h2>
<h3>Anders Solmor</h3>
<img src="../../images/Anders Solmor.png" alt="Portrait of Anders Solmor" width="auto" height="200">
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 23</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1349DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Noble</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Brash and inexperienced, Anders is a slight man with sharp features and a toothy smile.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Young Anders recently inherited his family’s fleet of fishing boats after the untimely death of his mother, Petra. He’s the youngest person ever to be elected to the council. Brash and inexperienced. His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit. Everyone involved in the town’s fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes’ practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers’ side.

  Anders is almost always accompanied by his butler, Skerrin Windchaser.</p>

<h3>Eda Oweland</h3>
<img src="../../images/Eda Oweland.png" alt="Eda Oweland" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Female</li>
<li>Age: 55</li>
<ul><li>Born:1317DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Merchant</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh Trads</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>She is a gruff, pragmatic woman whose graying hair is cut short and whose face bears the marks of a life lived outdoors.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Eda is the current senior member of the town council, as well as the owner of three large fishing boats. She has lived in Saltmarsh all her life and has been elected to the council three times.  Eda is keenly interested in expanding Saltmarsh’s fishing industry, her sights set on a wild section of the coast where she hopes to build a new dock. She is suspicious of the dwarves’ mining enterprise and doubts it will amount to much.</p>
<p>Eda swears like a sailor when she is frustrated or angry, and the folk in town who support her appreciate her willingness to stick up for them. Despite her temper, she respects those who keep their cool. Anyone who stands up to her wins her respect. Those who try to flatter her earn her contempt.</p>

<h3>Eliander Fireborn</h3>
<img src="../../images/Eliander Fireborn.png" alt="Eliander Fireborn" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 36</li>
<ul><li>Born:1336DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Fighter</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh Loyalist, Waterdeep</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Eliander fought in the royal army of Waterdeep, where he earned a name driving the wild things of the Dreadwood away from the settled lands. Eliander suffered a tremendous injury to his leg in a battle against an owlbear and now walks upon a finely carved wooden peg. Despite his injury and advancing age, the burly captain of the Saltmarsh town guard remains an imposing figure. Eliander is a local celebrity thanks to his facility with languages, and he is often called upon by the town’s various organizations to assist with translations. He is fully literate in Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elvish, and Halfling; he can also speak and understand Orc and Draconic. In a crisis, Eliander Fireborn might put the good of the crown above local rule. He possesses a royal writ that allows him to seize authority over the town guard in case of an emergency. He is loath to use it, as the locals might react to his seizure of power with an open revolt.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Caution guides Eliander’s thoughts and his every action. He recognizes that Saltmarsh is on the verge of tremendous growth, but he sees the influence of the Sea Princes behind every stroke of misfortune. Slow and steady wins the day, as he likes to say.</p>

<h3>Gellan Primewater</h3>
<img src="../../images/Gellan Primewater.png" alt="Gellan Primewater" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age:38</li>
<ul><li>Born:1334DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Noble</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh Trads</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Gellan is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. </p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town, but he now faces an intractable problem. Gellan made his fortune through smuggling, his textile and lumber exports serving as a cover for his illegal activities. When Saltmarsh was a sleepy backwater, he could operate with impunity. Now that Saltmarsh has attracted attention from the outside world, he sees business growing more difficult and less profitable.
  Over the years, Gellan has cultivated relationships with a number of contacts among the Sea Princes. His ships move illicit goods, including slaves, between their realm and Keoland. Gellan takes care to keep this side of his business quiet, since any hint of involvement with slave traders would mean the end of his days in Saltmarsh, if not his life.
  Gellan seeks to keep his smuggling cartel functioning with as little interference as possible. Having a seat on the council puts him in a perfect position to maintain his business while supporting all aspects of the traditionalists’ agenda. His popularity in the faction is second only to that of Eda Oweland.
  Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He pretends to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind Eda’s position. In truth, this deference is a ruse he uses to mask his efforts to shield his smuggling operation.</p>
  <p>Gellan loves to play the role of the foppish dandy. He enjoys fine wine, good food, and the latest fashions. He is a patron of the arts and spends lavishly to support festivals, plays, and concerts.</p>

<h3>Manistrad Copperlocks</h3>
<img src="../../images/Manistrad Copperlocks.png" alt="Manistrad Copperlocks" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Dwarf</li>
<li>Gender: Female</li>
<li>Age: 83</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1289DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Fighter</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh Loyalists, Mining Outfit</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Manistrad is a woman of few words. She is curt and quick, yet she gives every person who comes before the council a fair accounting. She’s nobody’s fool.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>The leader of the newly established mining operation in Saltmarsh is an iron-willed dwarven woman named Manistrad. She runs the mining outfit from a small office near the edge of town. Manistrad is a competent leader, as well as a savvy miner with a knack for pulling off impossible jobs. She’s convinced that the veins of silver found in the cliffs near Saltmarsh are indicative of more valuable stones deeper in the rock. She was once a fearsome warrior, and she’s not above delivering a few well-placed blows to ensure her orders are followed. Manistrad occupies an awkward place on the council. She was placed in her position by Waterdhavian decree; the Lords decided that if Saltmarsh is to support a mining operation, the miners would need a political voice. A more diplomatic figure might have smoothed over the tension, but Manistrad has little patience and sees the rest of the council, save for Eliander, as rustic dullards.</p>

<h2>Folk of Saltmarsh</h2>

<h3>Skerrin Windchaser</h3>
<img src="../../images/Skerrin Windchaser.png" alt="Skerrin Windchaser" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 45</li>
<ul><li>Born:1327DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Rogue</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: House Solmor</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Skerrin is the man-servant of Anders Solmor . Tall, lean, tan, with short silver hair, he speaks in precise, measured statements of a man who has a keen eye for detail. He is dispassionate and takes a protective stance toward Anders. To observers, he is a faithful and trusted butler.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Skerrin is literally a man of two personalities. He appears to be a concerned, fatherly figure, a loyal retainer who worries about his young master. With a few moments of focus, however, he can shift to become a cold-blooded, patient killer.</p>
---
<h3>Cragfin</h3>
<img src="../../images/Cragfin.png" alt="cragfin" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Carcharion</li>
<li>Gender: Mle</li>
<li>Age: 60</li>
<ul><li>Born:1312DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Fighter</li>
<li>Known Affiliations:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p> Cragfin is a terrifying sight. Standing over 7 feet tall, and hugely muscled he is not afraid to use his ghastly appearance to intimidate others. The carcharion's skin is riddled with deep, long scars, which are often visible due to his penchant for wearing a spiked leather chest harness above a leather kilt. His wide mouth is filled with rows of razor sharp teeth, which often still have bits of thankfully unidentifiable meat and gristle stuck in them. Most horrible however are Cragfin's eyes, which roll around as if with a life of their own.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Cragfin is the bouncer at The Empty Net in Saltmarsh, and chief enforcer of the proprietor Kreb Shenker. The tall Carcharion is a well-known figure in the town due to his unusual and imposing appearance. None would call him a friend however. Cragfin does the bidding of his master, Kreb Shenker, without question, and, like his boss, has a taste for violence. It has been said that on the rare quiet nights at The Empty Net old 'Fin will start tavern brawls on his own, just to relieve the boredom.</p>

<h3>Hanna Rist</h3>
<img src="../../images/Hanna Rist.png" alt="" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Female</li>
<li>Age: 35</li>
<ul><li>Born:1337DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Commoner</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh, Snapping Line</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Hanna comes from a family of well-known lobster catchers. The Rist family also makes a spirit from lobster meat and potatoes called claw wine; it is, to put it mildly, an acquired taste. Hanna employs several former dockhands to keep peace in her bar.</p>

<h3>Kreb Shenker</h3>
<img src="../../images/Kreb Shenker.png" alt="" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 47</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1325DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Thug</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh, The Empty Net</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Kreb is a large, mean-looking man with a seemingly permanent sneer on his face. A scraggly white beard frames his balding head, which is covered with scars and bumps. It would be a most generous person indeed who would call him a comely man.  
   His clothing does not appear to be any better kept than his health. Stained with dried ale, broth and blood, he wears a heavy leather apron whilst working.  
   Whilst hugely overweight, his girth hides a surprising strength, as many a rowdy patron has found out to their own cost.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>The proprietor of the notorious tavern, The Empty Net, Kreb is a lifelong inhabitant of the town of Saltmarsh, and known to most people there as someone best avoided if at all possible.  
  He will take anyone's money and ask no questions, but treats anyone who tries to cross him harshly. Kreb is a violent man with a bad temper.  
  Anyone making trouble in his tavern is thrown out into the Kingfisher River, in which the tavern stands on rickety stilts, or, if they are really unlucky, handed onto his chief bouncer Cragfin. He rarely bothers the town guard.</p>

<h3>Lankus Kurrid</h3>
<img src="../../images/Lankus Kurrid.png" alt="" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 55</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1317DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Veteran</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh Loyalist, The Wicker Goat</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Lankus is a conservative man, and dresses in plain, though well-made and tidy clothes. His greying hair and goatee frame a worn face that has a seemingly permanent frown, and his eyes have a slightly haunted look. He is proud of his past, and displays relics from his time in the Imperial armed forces behind the bar. He supports greater involvement from Waterdeer in matters pertaining to Saltmarsh and it's security. He still walks with a stiff soldier's stride, and practises his sword-work every morning in the yard outside the Goat.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Lankus Kurrid is the owner of The Wicker Goat in Saltmarsh, the oldest tavern in the town. A retired officer of the Waterdavhian Army, Lankus caters to a wide variety of clients, including the dwarven miners in the town and the town guard. He purchased the Goat with his retirement funds and savings he had accrued during his time in the Empire. </p>

<h2>Folk of Neverwinter</h2>

<h3>Lord Nasher Alagonder</h3>
<img src="../../images/Lord Nasher Alagondar.png" alt="" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race:Human</li>
<li>Gender:Male</li>
<li>Age: 73</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1299DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class:</li>
<li>Known Affiliations:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Nasher had a receding hairline. He was a deadly swordsman, and remained strong even into old age.

  He was brave in the face of his enemies but affable when among his people. He was renowned as a decisive, efficient, and fair ruler whose faith in Tyr made him a steady and just man. Accordingly, Nasher was much-beloved by his subjects, and was sometimes said to have been as much a shepherd of their wellbeing as a ruler over them.
  
  He had a great love of music and of hearing tales of faraway lands.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>During his younger years, Nasher adventured extensively for around ten years and garnered a great trove of magical items. His adventuring party was called The Northern Four Adventuring Troupe. The Adventuring Troupe included Dumal Erard, who later in life founded Helm's Hold; Ophala Cheldarstorn, matron of the Moonstone Mask; and the future high captain of Luskan, Kurth. One of the most famous tales of the Lord Nasher's past was the rescue of the Black Raven Tribe from an evil white dragon. During those adventuring days, it was common knowledge that Nasher once slew a minotaur. By the Year of the Lost Helm, 1329 DR, Nasher had retired from the life of an adventurer and had became ruler of the city of Neverwinter.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A woman of many faces, a beautiful tavern server or a cold-blooded killer and everything in between. Dressed to fit any situation, this ginger can be the center of attention or the shadow on the floor.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>She keeps her origins to herself, but she is known to have been apart of a failed attempt to seize the city of Myth Drannor by the Cult of the Dragon. Parting ways with the cult, she travelled for a while before settling in to her adoptive home of Neverwinter where she lives with her wife, Thisbe, and their daughter, Wynvere. While playing the doting mother, she maintains her skills and more than a few connections.</p>

<h3>Queen Othokent</h3>

<li>Known Affiliations: Dunwater</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Othokent is worldly for a lizardfolk. In her youth, she spent several years exploring the nearby marshes. She found human society interesting and observed caravans and villages in secret. She knows about the outside world but feigns ignorance in an attempt to catch the characters in a lie. She respects those who show her respect and treat her people as their equals, rather than as primitive fools to be mocked or patronized. Her experience with humans tells her that they can be useful allies, but she also knows that they can be duplicitous.</p>

<h3>Sauriv</h3>
<img src="../../images/Sauriv.png" alt="Sauriv" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Lizardfolk</li>

<ul><li>Born: 1312DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Commoner</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Dunwater</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>A life long servant of his tribe, Sauriv struggles to balance the traditions of his people with the wisdom from the wider world. Having explored widely as a young man, he is convinced that if he can thread the needle of tradition he can bring his people out of their isolationism.</p>

<h3>Vutha</h3>
<img src="../../images/Vutha.png" alt="Vutha" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Lizardfolk</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 41</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1331DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Commoner</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Dunwater</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Vutha has long been the apprentice of Sauriv. He has taken many journeys to carry messeges for the old minister, these trips have broaden the horizons of the younger minister and while he is more likely to defer to the clerics, Vutha is well aware of their limitations. He serves as a Co-ambassador with Litrix.</p>

---
<h3>Litrix</h3>
<img src="../../images/Litrix.png" alt="Litrix" height="200" />
<ul>
<li>Race: Lizardfolk</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 44</li>
<ul><li>Born: 1328DR</li>
  <li>Died:</li>
</ul>
<li>Class: Cleric</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Dunwater</li>
</ul>


<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>A reluctant ambassador, Litrix has seldom left the company of his tribe and never to anywhere as foreign as Saltmarsh. He was chosen, in part, because he was of middling rank among the clerics and because he got along well with the minister, Vutha, being childhood friends. The elder clerics believe this relationship with reign in the apprentice of Sauriv, whom they are convinced has been sent by the elder minister to drag the folk of Dunwater from the swamp.</p>

<h2>The Council of Saltmarsh</h2>
<h3>Anders Solmor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Race: Human</li>
<li>Gender: Male</li>
<li>Age: 23</li>
<li>Class: Noble</li>
<li>Known Affiliations: Saltmarsh</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Brash and inexperienced, Anders is a slight man with sharp features and a toothy smile.</p>

<h4>Backround</h4>
<p>Young Anders recently inherited his family’s fleet of fishing boats after the untimely death of his mother, Petra. He’s the youngest person ever to be elected to the council. Brash and inexperienced. His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit. Everyone involved in the town’s fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes’ practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers’ side.

  Anders is almost always accompanied by his butler, Skerrin Windchaser.</p>

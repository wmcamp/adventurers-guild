<p>After spending the last couple of weeks around town about your various tasks, you settle into the Snapped Line for another rainy spring evening, sated by the promise of hot food and good ale. The village locals filter in, taking long established seats around the tavern, tucking in for long established evening plans. Many nights have been wiled away here, drinking, carousing, and listening to the tales of the locals. A crowd favorite, Calim, an old sea dog who left the life of a fisherman when his son was taken by pirates several years back. Now he spent his days ashore, selling bait to the many crab boats that worked from the docks, and his nights here, drinking as much free ale as found him and telling old tales of the sea, the gods, and his topic this evening, the town.</p>

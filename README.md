<li>Real life news (ie. Birthdays, upcoming session info, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>World page</h2>
<p>The landing page for the various worlds, continents, countries, regions, towns, and specific locales.</p>

<h3>Sword Coast</h3>
<p>The Sword Coast is the main location for the Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign that we are running. It is full of wonderful, exciting, dangerous, and scary locations that the players interact with as they follow leads and chase mysteries through their adventures.</p>

<p>This page serves as the hub for all the various locations around the Sword Coast with links and a high res map. Following the links will take a player/user to more detailed pages for each pertinent location on the map. The information on the child pages will include maps, establishments (shops, taverns, government buildings), and points of interest. Each POI will have descriptions, current occupants/patrons, and various tidbits that pertain to the specific place (menus, list of wares, list of services offered).

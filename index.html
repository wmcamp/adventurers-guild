  <h2>Why a Guild?</h2>
  <p>"If Bakers and Smiths can figure out how to work together, why can't we?"<br></p>
  <p><em>--Stanis Highwater, Lord of Amphail and founder of the Adventurer's Guild</em></p>

  <p>The road is dangerous enough between hapless bandits and toughened warriors, without adding the trouble of walking it alone.
    When Stanis Highwater found the end of his road, he was loathed to give up an adventurer's life. He remembered the many sleepless 
    nights on the trail because he couldn't find decent help, or the help he could find wasn't exactly someone you wanted to sleep anywhere
    near. He had always wished there was a broader pool of adventurers he could call upon when his stalwart friends were called 
    away on other business. It was in just such a situation when he became the Lord of Amphail, Stanis had stumbled into a spot of 
    trouble, and without his friends at his back, it wouldn't have ended well for him or much of the Sword Coast.

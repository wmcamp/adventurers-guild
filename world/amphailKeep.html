<h2>Amphail Keep</h2>
  <p>Following the death of the previous ruling family, the Lord's Allaince recognized Stanis Highwater as the new Lord of Amphail. 
    Stanis set about building his ideal stronghold, a tavern. Amphail Keep is a strong redoubt against the dangers of the Sword Coast, but 
    it also plays host to the Highwater Inn. Situated in the middle of the bridge over the Phail River, the Keep serves as both Stronghold 
    and tavern. The Lord and proprietor, Lord Stanis Highwater is a retired adventurer who enjoys the company of the newer generations of his 
    old trade. Happy to stand behind the bar and listen or tell stories of glory and intrigue. The keep itself is a square structure with a corner 
    pointed at each bank and one each up and down river. The keep rises 5 stories over the water, with towers, 3 more levels, at the east (up) and 
    west (down river) corners. The Long Road passes through the keep on the third level with the main tavern on the fourth with rooms on the fifth.
